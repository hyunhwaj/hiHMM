1. To test hiHMM on a sample dataset, just execute "driv_hihmm.m" in matlab. You can modify the same file to test with your own dataset. 

2. For computational efficiency, you can use a subset of your data files to train the hiHMM and then use the trained model to annotate all files. Modify "tinfo" &  "list_tnames" to specify the training data, and "finfo" & "list_fnames" for test data.
